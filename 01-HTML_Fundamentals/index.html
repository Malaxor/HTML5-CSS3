      <h2>The Basic Language of the web: HTML</h2>
      <p>
         All modern websites and web applications are built with three
         <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the
         languages of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
         In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
         about, and why you too should learn it.
      </p>
      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
         HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext
         <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
         language, not a programming language, used by web developers to
         structure and describe the content of a webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
         HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
         paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
         understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>Each HTML element has 3 pieces:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Opening tag</li>
         <li>Content</li>
         <li>Closing tag</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Why Should You Learn HTML?</h3>
      <p>
         There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
         the web. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
         <li>
            To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
            Worpress or Wix
         </li>
         <li>To build web applications</li>
         <li>To impress friends</li>
         <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
